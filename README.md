# Sphere

## Realisation
In this project we see the main sphere and the obstacles that stand in front of it. When you press the screen, a small sphere is separated from the main sphere, while a long press creates a larger one, depending on the time of pressing. When the separated spheres come in contact with the obstacles, they explode and the main ball moves on until it reaches the finish line. If the main balloon is lost, we lose instantly. For spawning obstacle objects and small spheres, we used obje—Åt pooling to optimize the project.
